# image version deployed by the chart.
#
# Normally, the version of the Teleport Kubernetes Operator matches the
# version of the chart. If you install chart version 15.0.0, you'll use
# Teleport Kubernetes Operator version 15.0.0. Upgrading the operator is
# done by upgrading the chart.

# <Admonition type="warning">
# `teleportVersionOverride` is intended for development and MUST NOT be
# used to control the Teleport version in a typical deployment. This
# chart is designed to run a specific Teleport version. You will face
# compatibility issues trying to run a different Teleport version with it.
#
# If you want to run Teleport version `X.Y.Z`, you should use
# `helm install --version X.Y.Z` instead.
